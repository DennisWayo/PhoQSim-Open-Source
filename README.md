## Welcome to PhoQSim!
PhoQSim is an open-source photonic quantum simulator designed to enable researchers, educators, and developers to explore quantum photonic circuits with ease. Built to support Gaussian and non-Gaussian systems, PhoQSim bridges theoretical research and experimental implementation while prioritizing scalability, usability, and accessibility.

-----
## Introduction

Photonic quantum systems are at the forefront of quantum computing due to their scalability and potential for fault-tolerant computation. PhoQSim addresses the limitations of existing simulators, offering support for large-scale photonic circuits, real-time visualization, and a user-friendly interface. By prioritizing open collaboration and community-driven innovation, PhoQSim aims to democratize access to cutting-edge quantum photonics tools.
