# PhoQSim: Open-Source Photonic Quantum Simulator

## Welcome to PhoQSim!
PhoQSim is an open-source photonic quantum simulator designed to enable researchers, educators, and developers to explore quantum photonic circuits with ease. Built to support Gaussian and non-Gaussian systems, PhoQSim bridges theoretical research and experimental implementation while prioritizing scalability, usability, and accessibility.

## Key Features
	•	📡 Simulate Gaussian and Non-Gaussian Systems
Efficiently model photonic quantum circuits, including single-photon sources, squeezing operations, and photon-number-resolving detectors.
	•	🔄 Real-Time Visualization
Explore phase-space representations (e.g., Wigner functions) and photon distributions with intuitive visual tools.
	•	🔗 Integration-Ready
Seamlessly connects with platforms like Strawberry Fields, PennyLane, and device-level tools like Lumerical.
	•	🚀 Scalability and Performance
Leverages advanced computational techniques, including tensor networks and GPU acceleration, for large-scale systems.
	•	💡 Open-Source and Community-Driven
Contribute to and benefit from a growing ecosystem of photonic quantum tools.


## Getting Started

Coming soon.....

## Roadmap

PhoQSim’s development is structured into four key phases:
	1.	Research and Planning: Develop mathematical models for Gaussian and non-Gaussian systems.
	2.	Core Development: Implement scalable solvers and noise modeling.
	3.	Interface and Visualization: Build an interactive SwiftUI-based interface and real-time visualization tools.
	4.	Open-Source Launch: Release on GitHub with documentation, tutorials, and community engagement.
