# PhoQSim: Open-Source Photonic Quantum Simulator

## Welcome to PhoQSim!
PhoQSim is an open-source photonic quantum simulator designed to enable researchers, educators, and developers to explore quantum photonic circuits with ease. Built to support Gaussian and non-Gaussian systems, PhoQSim bridges theoretical research and experimental implementation while prioritizing scalability, usability, and accessibility.

## Key Features

- 📡 **Simulate Gaussian and Non-Gaussian Systems**  
  Efficiently model photonic quantum circuits, including single-photon sources, squeezing operations, and photon-number-resolving detectors.

- 🔄 **Real-Time Visualization**  
  Explore phase-space representations (e.g., Wigner functions) and photon distributions with intuitive visual tools.

- 🔗 **Integration-Ready**  
  Seamlessly connects with platforms like [Strawberry Fields](https://strawberryfields.ai), [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai), and device-level tools like Lumerical.

- 🚀 **Scalability and Performance**  
  Leverages advanced computational techniques, including tensor networks and GPU acceleration, for large-scale systems.

- 💡 **Open-Source and Community-Driven**  
  Contribute to and benefit from a growing ecosystem of photonic quantum tools.


## Getting Started

## Development Phases

PhoQSim’s development is structured into four key phases:

1. **Research and Planning**  
   Develop mathematical models for Gaussian and non-Gaussian systems.

2. **Core Development**  
   Implement scalable solvers and robust noise modeling.

3. **Interface and Visualization**  
   Build an interactive SwiftUI-based interface and real-time visualization tools.

4. **Open-Source Launch**  
   Release on GitHub with documentation, tutorials, and active community engagement.
